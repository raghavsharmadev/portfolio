                        <li>Developed API to mask phone numbers for privacy. A caller calls on a masked phone number,
                            and the end user only receives a masked number on display.</li>
                        <li>Developed scripts to originate calls with masked numbers and bridge calls.</li>
                        <li>Developed API to create campaigns and schedule them for a specific time on a day. At a
                            specific time, this campaign starts executing and users receive incoming calls with the
                            pre-defined audio bot.</li>
                        <li>Skills used: Spring boot, Java, Lua, MySQL, RESTful, Freeswitch, Linux</li>

                        <li>Enhanced API to reduce the time complexity of audio bots playing text by replacing
                            pre-determined
                            texts with audio clips instead of performing text-to-speech conversion at runtime.
                        <li>Enhanced the script to connect phone calls to audio bots. I used Lua scripting language to
                            call bot
                            API and stream bot response to the phone calls.</li>
                        <li>Interacted with other development teams to integrate their API with our application.
                            Enhanced the script for new business requirements.</li>
                        <li>Responsible to perform server setup for the application. I have to install Freeswitch,
                            Opensips, and
                            Unimrcp and configure the server for the service execution.</li>
